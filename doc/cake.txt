INTRODUCTION						*cake-introduction*

cake.vim is for easy jumping between Controller, Model and View files 
when developing in CakePHP.

Requirements:
- Vim ver.7.3 or heigher
- CakePHP ver.1.3.x or ver.2.x


==============================================================================
INSTALL							*cake-install*

1: Extract the file and Put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/).
2: Execute |:Cakephp| <Space> /path/to/cakephp_app/ command or in your .vimrc.
>
    let g:cakephp_enable_fix_mode = 1
    let g:cakephp_app = "/path/to/cakephp_app/"
<

When you find a project from open file automatically,
please set it as follows.
>
    let g:cakephp_enable_auto_mode = 1
<

And if you would like to use divided view themed such as "front" and "admin",
let g:cakephp_use_theme = "admin"
add the comment in your .vimrc.


MySQL and Apache logs to see the log quickly, and write the following.
>
    let g:cakephp_log = {
          \ 'query' : '/var/log/mysqld-query.log',
          \ 'access': '/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log'
          \ }
<

Sorry, this plugin will not work well for windows at this time.


More comfortable to use cake.vim, if you write key-mappings in your .vimrc. 
Here is recommended key-mappings.
>
    " Recommended  key-mappings.
    nnoremap <Space>cc :Ccontroller 
    nnoremap <Space>cm :Cmodel 
    nnoremap <Space>cv :Cview 
    nnoremap <Space>cl :Clog

>
  {
    "build_path": {
      "models": [
        "/full/path/to/models/",
        "/next/full/path/to/models/"
      ],

        "/next/full/path/to/helpers/"
      ]
    },
  }
<


		If there is a CakePHP core directory to a different location
		for each your application, it is useful without the
		|g:cakephp_core_path|, and I write on ".cake" as follows.
>
  {
    "build_path": {
      "models": [
        "/full/path/to/models/",
        "/next/full/path/to/models/"

        "/next/full/path/to/components/"
      ],
      "helpers": [
        "/full/path/to/helpers/",
        "/next/full/path/to/helpers/"
      ]
    },
    "cake" : "/path/to/another_cakephp_core/"
  }
<


		Please set if you want to change the ".cake" is the default
		name of the configuration file, such as the following.
>
  let g:cakephp_app_config_file = '.project'
<

g:cakephp_no_default_keymappings           *g:cakephp_no_default_keymappings*

		This plugin will define the following key mappings in Normal
		mode automatically. If you don't want these key mappings,
		define |g:cakephp_no_default_keymappings| before this plugin
		is loaded (e.g. in your |vimrc|).

		{lhs}	{rhs}
		------	---------------------------
		gf	<Plug>CakeJump
		gs	<Plug>CakeVSplitJump
		<C-w>f	<Plug>CakeSplitJump
		<C-w>gf	<Plug>CakeTabJump


		If you want to customize the key mapping, please use the
		|PluginCakephpInitializeAfter| event with autocmd statement.
		For example, the following code assign |<Plug>CakeJump| to
		"gf".

>
	function! s:init_cakephp()
		nmap <buffer> gf <Plug>CakeJump
	endfunction
	autocmd my-vimrc User PluginCakephpInitializeAfter call s:init_cakephp()
<

g:cakephp_gf_fallback_n                    *g:cakephp_gf_fallback_n*

		If there is no cakephp file when <Plug>CakeJump is called,
		|g:cakephp_gf_fallback_n| will be executed by |execute|.
		(Default: "normal! gf")

g:cakephp_gf_fallback_s                    *g:cakephp_gf_fallback_s*

		If there is no cakephp file when <Plug>CakeSplitJump is called,
		|g:cakephp_gf_fallback_s| will be executed by |execute|.
		(Default: "normal! \<C-w>f")

g:cakephp_gf_fallback_t                    *g:cakephp_gf_fallback_t*

		If there is no cakephp file when <Plug>CakeTabJump is called,
		|g:cakephp_gf_fallback_t| will be executed by |execute|.
		(Default: "normal! \<C-w>gf")

g:cakephp_test_window_vertical			*g:cakephp_test_window_vertical*

		If |vimproc| is installed, when you run |:Ctestrun| or
		|:Ctestrunmethod|, the results of the test is displayed in a
		window that is divided.
		If you want to split vertical, please set 1.
		default value is 0.

g:cakephp_test_window_height			*g:cakephp_test_window_height*

		The height of the splitter window for displaying the test
		results. If |g:cakephp_test_window_vertical| is 0, enabled.
		default value is 15.
